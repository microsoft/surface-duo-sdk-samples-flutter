# Basic Flutter sample with Surface Duo device info

A new Flutter project that includes the Surface Duo Android SDK and provides access to dual-screen device info from Dart.

The device info (`isDualScreenDevice` and `isAppSpanned`) is written to the console. For a more complete sample that _also_ updates the layout for two screens, refer to the [lightup_sample](../lightup_sample/).
